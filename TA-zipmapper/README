Description: This is a quality of life add-on that comes with a large lookup table of zip codes from around the world
and can take either a zip code or city and state/province combination and gives the latitude and longitude. 

The intended usecase is to simplify the addition of latitude/longitude data into assets tables but it can be used to
add value to any existing location data.

The lookup table has the following header:

city,county,lat,long,state,zip


Currently the county field is not used in the macro but is available with manual usage of the ZIP_CODES.csv lookup table for added information.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It comes with an overloaded macro named zipmap that has two uses:

`zipmap(ZIPCODE FIELD)` which adds the lat and long fields to an existing search.

`zipmap(CITY FIELD, STATE FIELD)` which evaluates the city and state to upper case and adds the lat and long field to an existing search.
